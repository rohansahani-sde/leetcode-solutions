# 3402. Minimum Operations to Make Columns Strictly Increasing

### Difficulty: Easy

## Description
You are given a m x n matrix grid consisting of non-negative integers.

In one operation, you can increment the value of any grid[i][j] by 1.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make all columns of grid strictly increasing.

 
Example 1:


Input: grid = [[3,2],[1,3],[3,4],[0,1]]

Output: 15

Explanation:


	To make the 0th column strictly increasing, we can apply 3 operations on grid[1][0], 2 operations on grid[2][0], and 6 operations on grid[3][0].
	To make the 1st column strictly increasing, we can apply 4 operations on grid[3][1].



Example 2:


Input: grid = [[3,2,1],[2,1,0],[1,2,3]]

Output: 12

Explanation:


	To make the 0th column strictly increasing, we can apply 2 operations on grid[1][0], and 4 operations on grid[2][0].
	To make the 1st column strictly increasing, we can apply 2 operations on grid[1][1], and 2 operations on grid[2][1].
	To make the 2nd column strictly increasing, we can apply 2 operations on grid[1][2].



 
Constraints:


	m == grid.length
	n == grid[i].length
	1 <= m, n <= 50
	0 <= grid[i][j] < 2500

        for(int c=0; c<m; c++){
            for(int i=1; i<n; i++){
                if(grid[i-1][c] < grid[i][c])continue;
                int need = (grid[i-1][c] + 1) - grid[i][c];
                grid[i][c] += need;
                sum += need;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
